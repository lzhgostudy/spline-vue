## Install

```bash
npm install spline-vue @splinetool/runtime
```

## Usage

To use **spline-vue**, first you have to go to the Spline editor, click on the **Export** button, select "**Code**" and then "**VanillaJS**".





You can copy the URL and pass it to the `<Spline />` component in Vue:

**For Vue2:**

```js
import Spline from "spline-vue/v2";
```

```vue
<template>
  <Spline :scene="scene" />
</template>

<script>
import Spline from "spline-vue/v2";

export default {
  components: { Spline },
  data() {
    return {
      scene: "https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode"
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

**For Vue3:**

```js
import Spline from "spline-vue/v3";
```

```vue
<template>
  <Spline :scene="scene" />
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from 'vue';
import Spline from "spline-vue/v3";

export default defineComponent({
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    Spline
  },
  data: () => ({
    scene: "https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode",
  })
});
</script>
```

You should be able to see the scene you exported in your Vue2/Vue3 app.

### Read and modify Spline objects

You can query any Spline object via `findObjectByName` or `findObjectById`.

_(You can get the ID of the object in the `Develop` pane of the right sidebar)._

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <Spline
      :scene="scene"
      :onLoad="onLoad"
    />
    <button type="button" @click="moveObj">
      Move Cube
    </button>
  </div>  
</template>
<script lang="ts">
/**
 * Example For Vue3
 */
import { defineComponent, ref } from "vue"
import Spline from "spline-vue/v3";
import type { Application, SPEObject } from "@splinetool/runtime";

export default defineComponent({
  components: { Spline },
  setup() {
    const scene = ref(
      "https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode"
    );
    const cube = ref<SPEObject>();
    const onLoad = (spline: Application) => {
      const obj = spline.findObjectByName('Cube');
      // or
      // const obj = spline.findObjectById('8E8C2DDD-18B6-4C54-861D-7ED2519DE20E');

      // save it in a ref for later use
      cube.value = obj;
    };
    const moveObj = () => {
      console.log(cube.value); 
      /**
        Spline Object => { 
          name: 'Cube', 
          id: '8E8C2DDD-18B6-4C54-861D-7ED2519DE20E', 
          position: {}, 
          ... 
        }
       */

      // move the object in 3D space
      cube.value.position.x += 10;
    };

    return {
      scene,
      onLoad,
      moveObj,
    };
  }
})
</script>
```

### Listen to events

You can listen to any Spline Event you set in the Events panel of the editor by attaching a listener to the Spline component.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <Spline
      :scene="scene"
      :onMouseDown="onMouseDown"
    />
  </div>  
</template>
<script lang="ts">
/**
 * Example For Vue3
 */
import { defineComponent, ref } from "vue"
import Spline from "spline-vue/v3";

export default defineComponent({
  components: { Spline },
  setup() {
    const scene = ref(
      "https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode"
    );
    
    const onMouseDown = (e) => {
      if (e.target.name === 'Cube') {
        console.log('I have been clicked!');
      }
    };

    return {
      scene,
      onMouseDown,
    };
  }
})
</script>
```

You can find a list of all of the Spline Event listeners in the [Spline Component Props](#spline-component-props) section.

### Trigger Spline events from outside

You can trigger any animation Event you set in the Events panel in the Spline Editor.

You can use the `emitEvent` function via the spline ref, passing the [event type](#spline-events) and the ID of your object.

_(You can get the ID of the object in the `Develop` pane of the right sidebar)._

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <Spline
      :scene="scene"
      :onLoad="onLoad"
    />
    <button type="button" @click="triggerAnimation">
      Trigger Spline Animation
    </button>
  </div>  
</template>
<script lang="ts">
/**
 * Example For Vue3
 */
import { defineComponent, ref } from "vue"
import Spline from "spline-vue/v3";
import type { Application, SPEObject } from "@splinetool/runtime";

export default defineComponent({
  components: { Spline },
  setup() {
    const scene = ref(
      "https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode"
    );
    const spline = ref<Application>();
    const cube = ref<SPEObject>();

    const onLoad = (splineApp: Application) {
      // save the app in a ref for later use
      spline.value = splineApp;
    }
    
    const triggerAnimation = (e) => {
      spline.value?.emitEvent('mouseHover', 'Cube');
      /**
       * Or you can query the spline object first, and then trigger the event:
       * 
       * cube.value?.emitEvent("mouseHover");
       */
    };

    return {
      scene,
      onLoad,
      triggerAnimation,
    };
  }
})
</script>
```

You can find a list of all of the Spline Events you can pass to the `emitEvent` function in the [Spline Events](#spline-events) section.

### Spline App Methods

The object exposed as a first argument of the `onLoad` function, is a Spline Application. You can call all these different methods on it.

| Name               | Type                                                       | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `emitEvent`        | `(eventName: SplineEventName, nameOrUuid: string) => void` | Triggers a Spline event associated to an object with provided name or uuid.                                                 |
| `emitEventReverse` | `(eventName: SplineEventName, nameOrUuid: string) => void` | Triggers a Spline event associated to an object with provided uuid in reverse order. Starts from last state to first state. |
| `findObjectById`   | `(uuid: string) => SPEObject`                              | Searches through scene's children and returns the object with that uuid.                                                    |
| `findObjectByName` | `(name: string) => SPEObject`                              | Searches through scene's children and returns the first object with that name.                                              |
| `setZoom`          | `(zoom: number) => void`                                   | Sets the initial zoom of the scene.                                                                                         |

### Spline Events
